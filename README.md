    ## Entry.js

        I call <SubmitData> function on <Submit> button to post data through Api. In this function first i use a check to avoid null values then i use another check for PlateNumber Validation "abc-111".

    ## Exit.js

        I call  <getTollsData> on <Calculate> button click to get data from the Api. In this function first i use a check to avoid null values then i use another check for PlateNumber Validation "abc-111". Then i get data from Api and after that i filter data on the basic of "PlateNumber" and "TripStatus" to get accurate data then i pass data from  <getTollsData> to <totalTaxtoBeCharged> function as "arguments". In the <totalTaxtoBeCharged> first i define all the required data and then i set the current format of "date" and apply that in conditions. In conditions i make a seperate  function <costValue> (to avoid data duplications), in which i pass required data as "arguments". By <costValue> function i got "distanceCost" value which i futher use in the conditions to get <TotalCostTripVal>. After that when i got all the data after calculations i update states and display all the calculations on the screen. then I pass that calculated data as "arguments" to <updateData> function, In which i finally update the Api data.
